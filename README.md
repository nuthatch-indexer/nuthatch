> **Be your own indexer.** One Rust binary, one command, live indexed API in under two minutes —
> AI-native, and with no mandatory third-party data API to trust or pay. Ever.

Self-hosted-first, AI-native blockchain indexer. Embedded mode runs as a single process with no
external services — no Postgres, no Docker, no IPFS. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the standing
design brief.

## Status: walking skeleton (slice 1)

This is the thinnest end-to-end path that actually runs — deliberately minimal. It proves the
`init → dev → live API` spine; the interesting layers grow onto it next.

| Working now | Coming (per build order) |
|---|---|
| `init` → ABI resolve (Sourcify → Etherscan) → scaffold | Parquet sealing + DuckDB analytics (slice 2) |
| RPC log polling with round-robin failover | DBSP declarative views / IVM (slice 3) |
| Deterministic ERC-20 `Transfer` decode | WASM transform runtime, Arrow WIT (slice 4) |
| Reorg self-healing (hot-store rollback) | MCP server + `llms.txt` + skills (slice 5) |
| Finality-gated Parquet sealing (content-addressed) | DBSP declarative views / IVM (slice 3) |
| Read-only analytical SQL (DuckDB) over sealed segments | WASM transform runtime, Arrow WIT (slice 4) |
| **IVM balance view (DBSP) — reorg = retraction** | reth ExEx tip mode, scaled Postgres mode (slice 6) |
| redb hot store, point-reads with cold fallback | |
| HTTP API (`/`, `/entities`, `/entity/{id}`) | reth ExEx tip mode, scaled Postgres mode (slice 6) |

Scope of the skeleton: **one chain (Ethereum), Transfer events only, RPC polling, redb-only.**
No IVM, no DuckDB/Parquet, no MCP yet.

### Measured footprint (the number nobody else publishes)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Peak RAM** | **~37 MB** (hot indexing + sealing + DuckDB SQL, live mainnet) |
| Binary size | 49 MB (release; DuckDB + DBSP statically bundled — 5.8 MB without them) |
| Budget | ≤2 GB RAM — **using 1.8%** of it |

Honest and reproducible: `nuthatch init 0xA0b8…eB48 && nuthatch dev --backfill 200`, sampled with
`ps -o rss`. Measured on the release build with the full slice-2 pipeline active. The RAM budget is
the CI-enforced one and holds comfortably; the binary grew because DuckDB bundles a C++ engine
statically (still a single file — the embedded-mode non-negotiable). Hot layer stays bounded by
pruning sealed rows to Parquet past finality.

## Quickstart

```sh
cargo build --release

# Index USDC on mainnet (uses public RPC defaults; no key needed)
./target/release/nuthatch init 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 --chain mainnet
./target/release/nuthatch dev

# in another shell
curl localhost:8288/
curl localhost:8288/entities?limit=5
```

`init` writes `nuthatch.toml` (config) and `abi.json` (resolved ABI). `dev` polls logs, decodes
Transfers into an embedded `nuthatch.redb`, and serves the API on `127.0.0.1:8288`.

## Design principles (non-negotiable)

- **Single static binary**, zero external services in embedded mode.
- **≤2 GB RAM** for single-chain tip-following + serving (a CI-enforced budget, not a hope).
- **No phone-home** — no telemetry, no mandatory tokens. AI features are local-first (Ollama / BYO-key).
- **Determinism in the core** — decode, reorg, and entity derivation are deterministic and
  re-executable. LLMs write code and tests; they never sit in the runtime data path.

## Progress log

Newest first. One entry per push, tracking the [build order](CLAUDE.md#build-order-vertical-slices-each-ends-runnable).

- **2026-07-14 — Slice 3: DBSP declarative views (the IVM core).** The first derived entity —
  per-address token balances — is now a **declarative incremental view**, not a hand-rolled handler.
  Balance is stated as Σ(in) − Σ(out) and maintained by a DBSP circuit: a new transfer is a +1 delta,
  and a **reorg is the same transfer re-fed with weight −1** (a retraction) — the identical circuit
  serves backfill and tip. Served at `/balances` and `/balance/{address}`. Verified: a deterministic
  golden test proves incremental maintenance + retraction convergence; live run derived 2,257 holder
  balances (top holder correctly the zero/burn address), **peak RAM 36.9 MB**. 14 tests green.
  _Known limits (this slice): balances accumulate in i64 base units (fine for USDC-class tokens); the
  view is in-memory and rebuilt per process — a warm restart resumes indexing but does not yet replay
  prior balances (persistence/replay is a later slice)._
- **2026-07-14 — Slice 2 complete: DuckDB SQL + hot-store pruning.** A read-only `/sql` endpoint
  runs analytical queries over the sealed segments via an embedded, memory-capped DuckDB (segments
  attached read-only; ingestion never writes DuckDB). Once a range is sealed and catalogued, its
  rows are pruned from the redb hot store — and `/entity/{id}` transparently falls back to DuckDB for
  pruned rows, so point-reads work seamlessly across the hot→cold seam. Verified live: sealed +
  pruned a 2,497-row segment, `/sql` aggregations correct, a pruned id resolved via the cold path;
  **peak RAM 37 MB** with the full pipeline. Binary is now 44 MB (DuckDB bundled). 13 tests green.
- **2026-07-14 — Slice 2 (in progress): Parquet sealing.** Once a block range passes finality
  (a conservative 64-block depth for now), its entities are sealed to an immutable, content-addressed
  (sha256) Snappy Parquet segment under `segments/`, catalogued in `manifest.json` with block bounds
  and row count; a monotonic `sealed_through` watermark advances so each block seals exactly once. The
  hot store is deliberately *not* pruned yet — point-reads keep hitting redb until the DuckDB serving
  path lands. Verified live: sealed a 2,355-row segment for finalized mainnet USDC; round-trips through
  Arrow in tests (10 tests green). The append-only cold layer never sees a reorg, by construction.
- **2026-07-14 — Slice 2 (in progress): reorg safety.** Block-hash checkpoints + `rollback_to`
  in the hot store; the indexer detects when its last committed block falls off the canonical
  chain and rolls back to the deepest surviving checkpoint. Reorgs land *only* in the mutable hot
  store — the invariant that lets later slices seal to immutable Parquet strictly past finality. A
  proptest asserts convergence: any random fork depth + alternate branch reaches the same state as
  indexing the winning branch directly (7 tests green). Verified live: no false reorgs on mainnet.
- **2026-07-14 — Slice 1 gate closed.** 5 deterministic golden decode tests (fixed USDC-transfer
  fixture → exact output) pass; measured peak RAM **~33 MB** indexing 7,013 transfers — 1.6% of the
  2 GB budget. Both non-negotiables (tests + footprint) met, so slice 2 is unblocked.
- **2026-07-14 — Slice 1: walking skeleton.** `init` (ABI via Sourcify v2, Etherscan fallback) →
  `dev` (RPC log polling with round-robin failover) → deterministic ERC-20 `Transfer` decode →
  redb hot store → axum HTTP API. Verified alive against live mainnet USDC, keyless: 170+ transfers
  indexed in ~1.5s with correct decimal values. Scope: one chain, Transfer-only, RPC-poll, redb-only.

_Next: Slice 4 — WASM transform runtime (ported from liminal) with batched Arrow WIT interfaces._
