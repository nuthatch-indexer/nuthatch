//! Read-only analytical SQL over the sealed Parquet segments **and the hot tip**, via an embedded
//! DuckDB. DuckDB is single-writer/OLAP: we only ever ATTACH the segments read-only here; the
//! ingestion path never writes DuckDB. The sealed segments cover finalized history; the unsealed tip
//! lives in redb. For `/sql` (RFC-0013) the hot rows are scanned into per-table temp tables and
//! `UNION ALL`'d into each table's view. Hot and cold are kept disjoint *structurally* by the
//! `sealed_through` watermark (COR-1): cold includes only segments finalized at/below it, hot only rows
//! past it - so the union is exact with no dedup, even across the brief seal→prune window. Trusted
//! point-reads pass no hot rows (and `u64::MAX`, i.e. all segments).
//!
//! The binary stays single-file: DuckDB is statically bundled. Memory is capped so an analytical
//! query can't blow the embedded-mode RAM budget.
